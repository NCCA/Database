#Modern C++ example

This demo uses the excellent [sqlite_modern_cpp](https://github.com/aminroosta/sqlite_modern_cpp) header library.

I have included a working version of it in the library ../sqlite_modern_cpp

to compile use the following 

```
clang++ -std=c++11 modern.cpp -I ../sqlite_modern_cpp -I/public/devel/include -L/public/devel/lib -lsqlite3
```
